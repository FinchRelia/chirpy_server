= Chirpy Server

This repository holds my version of https://boot.dev[boot.dev] HTTP Servers course. It consists in an API where users can log in and send messages (chirps).

== Get started

Chirpy relies on a Postgres database (the database should be created first). Needed environment variables are:

* DB_URL: Postgres URL connection
* PLATFORM: dev, on purpose of the course
* JWT_SECRET: can be generated using `openssl rand -base64 64`
* POLKA_KEY: predefined dummy API key used to illustrate webhook feature
